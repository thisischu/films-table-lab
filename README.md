# HTML Tables 
## Lab: The Films of Hayao Miyazaki 🎬 🎥 

### Directions

Your goal is to [**recreate this table**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/films-table-lab/main/Films_tables.png) using your knowledge of basic and advanced HTML table structure.

**After** you've gotten your table structure to match, you may style this table according to your own preferences; however, you styling should enhance the _clarity_ and _readability_ of your table. A couple of things to keep in mind:
  * Your column and row headers should be bold.
  * If you opt for color, lighter colors are easier on the eyes.
  * Alternating colors can make it easier for the reader to distinguish between rows.

As always...
  1. If this is a *Practice or Pairing Lab*, fork this repo and clone down the forked repo **OR** if this is a *Lab Assignment* that was generate using Github classroom, then your repo name will end in your username. No need to fork, just clone this repo without forking it.
  2. Create your HTML and CSS files.
  3. Stage, commit, and push your changes regularly.
  4. If this is a *Lab Assignment*, submit the URL of your repo to Canvas. If this is a *Practice or Pairing Lab*, you can open a PR to denote that you are done.
