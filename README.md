# HTML Tables 
## Lab: The Films of Hayao Miyazaki 🎬 🎥 

### Directions

Your goal is to [**recreate this table**](https://codepen.io/annmarcylabschool/full/wvGVZEq) using your knowledge of basic and advanced HTML table structure.

**After** you've gotten your table structure to match, you may style this table according to your own preferences; however, you styling should enhance the _clarity_ and _readability_ of your table. A couple of things to keep in mind:
  * Your column and row headers should be bold.
  * If you opt for color, lighter colors are easier on the eyes.
  * Alternating colors can make it easier for the reader to distinguish between rows.

As always...
  1. If this is a *Practice Lab*, fork this repo and clone down the forked repo. **OR**
      * If this is a *Lab Assignment*, just clone this repo without forking it.
  2. Create your own HTML and CSS files.
  3. Stage, commit, and push your changes regularly.
  4. If this is a *Practice Lab*, open a pull request into `The-Marcy-Lab-School:master` branch to submit. **OR**
      * If this is a *Lab Assignment*, copy the URL of this repo and submit it through Canvas.
